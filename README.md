 ## SOME USEFUL TERMS IN MACHINE LEARNING  
-----------------------------------------

- Decision Tree
- Bias-Variance trade off<br><br>


- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Random Forest<br><br>


- Cross Validation 
	- Four-Fold cross validation
	- Leave one out cross validation
	- Ten-Fold Cross validation

- Confusion Matrix : A confusion matrix tells you what your machine learning algorithm did right and what did it wrong.
  - if we had N things to choose from, we get a confusion matrix with N rows and N columns.<br><br>

- Sensitivity = True Positive/(True Positive + False Negative)
- Specificity = True Negative/(True Negative + False Positive)
- We can use Sensitivity and Specificity to help us decide which machine learning method would be best for our data.
  	-	If Correctly identifying positives is the most important thing to do with the data, we should choose a method with higher sensitivity.
  	-	If Correctly identifying negative is more important, then we should put more emphasis on Specificity.<br><br>

- Bias - The inability for a machine learning method (like kinear regression) to capture the true relationship is called Bias.
- Variance - The difference in fits between data set is called variance.
- Overfit - Model fits training data too well, fails on new data.
